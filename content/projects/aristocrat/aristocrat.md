Aristocrat is simple utility that allows you to decode barcodes on your screen and read the text in images and scanned PDFs.

After choosing "Capture Screen..." in the Aristocrat menu bar, select an area of your screen (which can be done through a system-wide hotkey) and Aristocrat works its magic.

It then either performs Optical Character Recognition on any selected text or decodes any of the following barcode types:

- EAN-8 and EAN-13
- Code 39
- Code 93
- Code 128
- ITF
- Codabar
- RSS-14
- QR Code
- Data Matrix
- Aztec
- PDF 417

The results can then easily be copied to your pasteboard or shared from the Aristocrat menu.
