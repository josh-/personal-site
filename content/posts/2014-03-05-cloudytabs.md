Using Chrome on OS X and Safari on my iOS devices means that I'm not able make use of iCloud Tabs – Apple's tab syncing solution. [CloudyTabs](/projects/cloudytabs/) attempts to solve this.

[CloudyTabs](/projects/cloudytabs/) is my simple menu bar application that the iCloud Tabs on all the devices in your iCloud account.

To use CloudyTabs, open the app and select a tab from one of your devices. The tab's URL then opens it in your default browser, Cmd-Selecting a tab (or highlighting it and pressing Cmd-Return) opens the tab in the background. Opt-Selecting a tab (or highlighting it and pressing Opt-Return) will copy the tab's URL to your pasteboard.

Typing the first few letters or a tab's title will jump to that particular tab.

Hovering over the CloudyTabs menu bar icon displays a tooltip which lists the date that iCloud last updated the synced tabs plist (where CloudyTabs reads data from).

I've been absolutely blown away with the coverage that its received – after I emailed the awesome [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci), it was written up on [Macstories](http://www.macstories.net/news/cloudytabs-puts-icloud-tabs-in-your-macs-menu-bar/) and then on [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/2106360/cloudytabs-review-liberate-icloud-tabs-from-safari-on-your-mac.html), [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/03/cloudytabs-pulls-up-your-icloud-bookmarks-right-in-your-menubar/), [The Sweet Setup](http://thesweetsetup.com/quick-tip-get-icloud-tabs/), and many other fantastic sites. The enthusiasm shown for CloudyTabs has been insane and it's truly humbling that people seem to like it.

It's [available now](/projects/cloudytabs/) for free and the [source code](https://github.com/josh-/CloudyTabs/) is licensed under the MIT.
