[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/), for those who aren't aware, is the name Apple gives its suite of developer tools. It includes the Xcode IDE, as well as an array of various command-line tools and GUI apps that all aid in the process of developing software for Apple platforms.

However, as any iOS or Mac developer is surely aware, people have a really difficult time capitalizing *Xcode*. Following Apple's other naming schemes it is often styled as *xCode* or the even worse *XCode*. Sometimes lazily appearing as *xcode*.

As someone who is somewhat of a perfectionist and is [irritated by seeing this silly error over and over again](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/commit/e977e27d497f6c24bd6b5f89b63b8c28d986688c), I forked Steven Frank's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/tree/master/Source) browser extension and made [Xcode Stylerizer](https://github.com/josh-/Xcode-Stylerizer), an extension that simply walks the DOM after the page has loaded and fixes all incorrectly styled instances of *Xcode*.

All installation instructions are available on GitHub in the README and I welcome pull requests and issue reports. Happy *Xcode'ing*.
